title: Determining the resolution limits of electron-beam lithography
---

Our work focused on better characterizing the point-spread-function (PSF) of the electron beam in electron beam lithography. I developed Monte Carlo simulations to simulate the PSF for comparison with my team's empirical results. Our work was published in [Nano Letters](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5013773) in 2014.
