During the Large Hadron Collider's (LHC) upgrade in 2013, I worked with the Compact Muon Solenoid group to study and verify that the Higgs Boson to ZZ Bosons to 4 lepton decay channel could continue to be detected under increased LHC luminosity and power. Our work was published in a public [CERN analysis note](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1607076?ln=en).
