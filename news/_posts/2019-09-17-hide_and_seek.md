Very excited to release results on agents learning progessively more complex strategy and tool use from multi-agent hide-and-seek; see [blog](https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/)/[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07528) and some cool press coverage in [Finanical Times](https://www.ft.com/content/1e215356-d961-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/20/20872672/ai-learn-play-hide-and-seek), [MIT Tech Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614325/open-ai-algorithms-learned-tool-use-and-cooperation-after-hide-and-seek-games/), [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/clever-hide-and-seek-ais-learn-to-use-tools-and-break-the-rules/), [IEEE](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents-startle-researchers-with-unexpected-strategies-in-hideandseek), [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2216410-ai-learns-to-defy-the-laws-of-physics-to-win-at-hide-and-seek/), [Venture Beat](https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/17/openai-and-deepmind-teach-ai-to-work-as-a-team-by-playing-hide-and-seek/), and [Sync](https://medium.com/syncedreview/why-playing-hide-and-seek-could-lead-ai-to-humanlike-intelligence-42604d1d6b90).
