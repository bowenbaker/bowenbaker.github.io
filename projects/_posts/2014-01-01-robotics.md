I co-founded the [MIT Robotics Team](http://roboteam.mit.edu/) in late 2013. I led the software team for 2 years, during which we placed 2nd in the 2014 NASA [RASC-AL ROBO-OPS Competition](http://robo-ops.nianet.org/) and competed in the 2015 NASA [Sample Return](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html) Centennial Challenge.
