I am a co-founder at [Perch](http://www.perch.fit/). We are an early stage weight room analytics startup and went through the MIT [delta v](http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/accelerator/) accelerator last summer (2016). I work on machine vision, rep tracking algorithms, and most other aspects of the product back-end.
