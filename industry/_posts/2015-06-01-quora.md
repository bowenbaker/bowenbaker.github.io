I was a Data Science Intern at [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) in the summer of 2015. I worked on identifying and fixing categorically misused topics, improving automated topic labeling, and exploring topic geometries. I also helped in creating metric dashboards, responding to company data inquiries, and fixing bugs in data logging.
