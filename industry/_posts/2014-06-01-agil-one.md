I was a Data Science Intern at [AgilOne](http://www.agilone.com/) during my 2014 Summer break. I created a framework for validating customer data before running the machine learning models. On top of this, I built a deployment framework that would automatically select features to use and initialize models for new customers. I also did some minor work on the product front end.
